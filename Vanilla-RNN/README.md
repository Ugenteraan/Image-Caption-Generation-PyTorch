# Vanilla-RNN

## Introduction
We'll go through the basic architecture of a vanilla RNN along with Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and perform a NumPy implementation of the said architecture.

This note is written based on the assumption that you are already familiar with basic neural network architectures and backpropagation.
